Command line arguments can be read from an indirect file / response file by specifying the file with @_name_ in the command line.
Each line in the file is interpreted as command line argument, shell like escape sequences are not available.
The file can contain further @_name_ inputs.
If the file cannot be found the argument is used literally.
