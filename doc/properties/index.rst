Properties computed from the tight-binding Hamiltonian
=======================================================

Based on the electronic structure defined by the implemented xTB Hamiltonians in ``tblite``, a set of properties can be computed.

We feature the following properties:
  * atomistic properties based on Mulliken partitioning :doc:`xtbml <xtbml/index>`
  * molecular multipole moments
  * Mayer-Wiberg bond orders
